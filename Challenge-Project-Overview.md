## 📋 BTT Internal Evaluation Notes
*(This section is for BTT staff and CAs only — remove before sharing with students)*

### Technical Vetting
| Check | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Python Compatibility | 🟢 | Project utilizes standard Python NLP libraries (HuggingFace, Scikit-learn, Pandas). No exotic frameworks requested. |
| Data Readiness | 🟡 | Data sources are clean but disparate across multiple repositories. Students will need to normalize heterogeneous schemas from LMSYS and JailbreakBench. |
| Resource Check | 🟡 | Potential risk if students attempt to use local LLMs for inference; project must enforce API-call-only or lightweight local embedding models to fit Colab memory constraints. |

### Internal Scores
- **Student Fit Score:** 6.5/10
- **Technical Depth Score:** 8/10
- **Overall Recommendation:** REVISE

### Advisor Feedback Draft
This project offers a compelling real-world application of AI governance. To succeed, first, pivot the focus from a 'Gateway' infrastructure (which risks becoming a DevOps exercise) to an 'Evaluation Pipeline' that labels and categorizes prompt safety. Second, strictly limit the model selection to a maximum of two endpoints to prevent excessive boilerplate code. Please submit a refined data pipeline schema by EOW to finalize the scope.

# Governed Prompt Gateway: Token Efficient and safety aware LLM routing for regulated customer

**Company / Org:** Other  
**Challenge Advisor:** Bhavana Unnam, [Email address]    
**Program:** Break Through Tech AI Studio - Fall 2026  

---

## 🏢 About Other
Other operates within the specialized domain of enterprise AI governance, focusing on the secure and cost-efficient deployment of generative models in high-stakes industries. The team is dedicated to building robust frameworks that bridge the gap between experimental AI capabilities and the rigorous compliance standards required by regulated customer service environments.

---

## 🎯 The Challenge
### Project Summary
In this project, you will use publicly available customer-service, insurance question answering, toxic prompt, jailbreak, and hallucination datasets and NLP classification, semantic similarity, prompt optimization, retrieval-augmented generation, caching, and LLM evaluation techniques to build a governed prompt gateway that screens user queries, detects unsafe requests, reduces token usage, estimates cost, and recommends the best LLM model tier before a prompt is executed. This will help our company address the business problem of deploying generative AI safely and cost effectively by reducing LLM spend, improving response reliability, and creating an auditable governance layer for regulated customer service use cases.

### Success Criteria

**Safety and governance accuracy**

- Target success metric:
  - Achieve strong baseline performance on harmful-query and risk classification.
  - Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  - A successful target would be 80%+ F1 score on prompt-risk classification.

**Token reduction and cost efficiency**

- Target success metric:
  - Compare original prompt token count against optimized prompt token count.
  - A successful target would be 30–50% reduction in input tokens for eligible prompts.
  - Estimate cost savings across a simulated workload of customer-service queries.

**Cache effectiveness**

- Target success metric:
  - Measure cache-hit rate across a test set with repeated and similar queries.

**A successful December demo:**

- User enters a query.
- System classifies the query intent and risk.
- Unsafe queries are blocked or redirected.
- Safe queries are optimized for token reduction.
- Similar queries trigger cache reuse.
- Dashboard displays token savings, cost estimate, risk score, and recommended model tier.
- Final response is generated or simulated with an auditable decision log.

### Stretch Goals

There are several ways to stretch this project but i fear this is already too much for an implementation for grads. I am open to add one or two scopes though.

- **Jurisdiction-aware policy profiles**
  - Fellows can create configurable policy templates for different regions or industries, such as insurance, banking, healthcare, or education. The goal would not be to provide legal advice, but to show how enterprise AI governance rules can be customized.
- **Automated prompt testing suite**
  - Fellows can build a test harness that runs many prompts through the gateway and reports safety accuracy, token reduction, cache performance, cost estimates, and routing consistency.

### Project Milestones
Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a GitHub Projects board to track tasks within each milestone.

|---|---|---|
| September | Problem Definition, Data Setup, and Baseline Design | • Finalize project scope and success criteria.<br>• Select public datasets and complete initial data exploration.<br>• Define prompt-risk categories and governance rules.<br>• Build a basic data pipeline for loading and preprocessing text data.<br>• Create a baseline query classifier for intent and risk detection.<br>• Establish baseline metrics for safety classification, token usage, and response quality. |
| October | Governance Layer, Prompt Optimization, and Caching Prototype | • Build the first working version of the prompt governance layer.<br>• Implement harmful-query and jailbreak-detection logic.<br>• Add prompt compression or prompt-refinement functionality.<br>• Implement semantic similarity or embedding-based caching.<br>• Measure token reduction compared to baseline prompts. |
| November | Evaluation Dashboard, and Final Demo Preparation | • Complete the end to end governed prompt gateway workflow.<br>• Add model recommendation logic based on cost, complexity, risk, and use case.<br>• Finalize the dashboard showing governance decisions, token savings, cost estimates, cache status, and model recommendation.<br>• Evaluate the system using metrics such as harmful-query detection accuracy, token reduction, cache-hit rate, and cost-savings estimate.<br>• Prepare final presentation, architecture diagram, demo script, and project documentation. |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.
